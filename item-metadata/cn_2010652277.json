Among the vignettes are women promenading while \"Displaying Gowns at the Summer Resort\" and \"Kow-towing to Royalty\", \"Coaching in the Highlands\" and spending \"All Day on the Golf-Links\", \"Cruising in the Mediterranean\" and \"Being 'Sporty' at Monte Carlo\". This sort of rake's progress \"among the 'Smart Set'\" ends with a final vignette labeled \"What it Leads to\" that shows a long line of well-dressed men and women leading to the judge's bench where he hands out documents labeled \"Divorce\"."

        "Like books and magazines in the Library's general collections, this set of websites complements the original and historical visual material held in the Prints &amp; Photographs Division. Included are sites for photographers and cartoonists represented in P&amp;P (e.g., Kuper, Prokudin-Gorskii, Rogovin, and Telnaes). Also, websites for new digital image formats (e.g., Wrist photography, Reicholdarts cell phone photos, and Micah Wright remix posters). Other sites document new ways of displaying the visual arts through virtual galleries (e.g., Alternative Museum) and new ways of representing architectural work and the built environment (e.g., McKissack, Pritzker Prize, Vergara's Invincible Cities, and Vi&#241;oly). Major then-current event themes include views of Kurdistan and the Iraq War."

        "\"Mobile sources contribute large percentages of each pollutant, but technology is not yet available to measure and tax emissions from each vehicle.  We build a behavioral model of household choices about vehicles and miles traveled.  The ideal-but-unavailable emissions tax would encourage drivers to abate emissions through many behaviors, some of which involve market transactions that can be observed for feasible market incentives (such as a gas tax, subsidy to new cars, or tax by vehicle type).  Our model can calculate behavioral effects of each such price and thus calculate car choices, miles, and emissions.A nested logit structure is used to model discrete choices among different vehicle bundles.  We also consider continuous choices of miles driven and the age of each vehicle.  We propose a consistent estimation method for both discrete and continuous demands in one step, to capture the interactive effects of simultaneous decisions.  Results are compared with those of the traditional sequential estimation procedure\"--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

        "\"Scene opens in a photographer's studio. A typical old maid, impersonated by Mr. Gilbert Saroni [sic], enters to have her picture made. While the photographer is making his camera ready the old maid walks about the studio. She first looks at a hanger with a number of photo samples, which immediately falls from the wall, not being able to stand her gaze. She then looks at the clock and her face frightens the clock and causes the hands to turn around at lightning speed, and the clock suddenly falls to the floor with a crash. She then walks over to the mirror to ascertain the trouble, and as she presents herself in front of the glass it suddenly cracks in several places. The photographer then sits her in a chair and poses her ready for her picture. Just as he is to press the button the camera explodes with a great puff of smoke, completely destroying the camera and demolishing the studio. The picture finishes up with the old maid tipping back in her chair and losing her balance, displaying a large quantity of fancy lace goods. A sure winner. Length 75 feet\"--Edison films catalog, no. 105."
