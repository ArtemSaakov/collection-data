The container locations and image counts appear after each name. There are duplicate prints of many images, but the image counts reflect only the number of unique shots per person per container. Some individuals are represented in both Group I and Group II, sometimes by the same image and sometimes by different images. About 16 percent of the portraits in the NWP records have been digitized as part of the American Memory Web site Women of Protest: Photographs from the Records of the National Woman’s Party.

        "The origins of the National Woman's Party (NWP) date from 1912, when Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, young Americans schooled in the militant tactics of the British suffrage movement, were appointed to the National American Woman Suffrage Association's (NAWSA) Congressional Committee. They injected a renewed militancy into the American campaign and shifted attention away from state voting rights toward a federal suffrage amendment."

        "This dataset is an export of transcriptions for 5,760 images from the Carrie Chapman Catt Papers created by volunteers participating in the Library of Congress crowdsourcing program By the People (https://crowd.loc.gov) campaign, Carrie Chapman Catt Papers. It contains text created by volunteers through a transcription and review process, volunteer-created tags, digital collections metadata, and metadata representing the arrangement of the items in the By the People platform, Concordia. This dataset includes transcriptions and data generated from the pages in the By the People campaign Carrie Chapman Catt Papers (https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns/carrie-chapman-catt-papers/). The campaign consisted of all currently online images of digitized content from the Carrie Chapman Catt Papers (http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000077) transcribed in their entirety. The papers of suffragist, political strategist, and pacifist Carrie Lane Chapman Catt (1859-1947) span the years 1848-1950 and reflect Catt's steadfast dedication to the rights of women, particularly the right to vote, and world peace. The transcription campaign included the diaries, general correspondence, and speech and article file series of the collection. See the Catt digital collection for all available online items for this collection, as well as contextual information, such as bibliographic resources. Note: This dataset may contain UNICODE characters or lengthy transcriptions which may display incorrectly in some spreadsheet editors.

Version 2, description of contents: This dataset includes 2019667239_v2.zip - a zip file containing a CSV file and a README file. carrie-chapman-catt-papers_2022-10-12.csv contains campaign, project, item, itemID, asset, and asset status metadata, as well as an image URL, the volunteer-created transcriptions, and volunteer-created tags.

        "Founded in 1913 as the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CU), the National Woman's Party (NWP) was instrumental in raising public awareness of the women's suffrage campaign. Using a variety of tactics, the party successfully pressured President Woodrow Wilson, members of Congress, and state legislators to support passage of a 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guaranteeing women nationwide the right to vote. In so doing, the NWP established a legacy defending the exercise of free speech, free assembly, and the right to dissent."
