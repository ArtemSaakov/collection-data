Just for old time's sake, hang up your socks, the nurses at the Dartford hospital told all the American boys and sure enough, by the time the morning sun began peeping in at the windows, the Red Cross Santa Claus has visited every bed and filled every stocking. On the splinted arm of Private Edward Davidson of Brooklyn, N.Y. Santa pinned an extra spray of holly, real English holly, picked in the hospital gardens. Davidson had lain six days in a shell hole and twelve weeks in a hospital unable to move while his injured arm was mending. \"Poor Lad\", said Santa, \"We must make it a good Christmas for him\"",

Miss Fleenor happened to be out at Dartford talking with the men. Some of the boys learned that she had been speakers in the drive in America last Spring. \"Why don't you make us a speech?\" suggested Private John Anderson of Nashville. She replied that she didn't have any speeches ready except Red Cross speeches. \"That's just what we want\", said the crowd. So the men gathered around and listened to a regular \"Drive\" speech. At the end of the speech a young sergeant suggested, \"But Miss, it don't seem right that just because we're over here we can't join the A.R.C. ain't there some way for us to be members\" All those who want to join hold up your hands.\" said Miss Fleenor, and every hand in the room shot up as a general scramble ensued the room to see which man would be first to join",

        "Introduction Lantern Projector from: Thomas Cradock Hepworth, Book of the Lantern. New York: Edward L. Wilson, 1889 Prokudin-Gorskii created his negatives by using a camera that exposed one oblong glass plate three times in rapid succession through three different color filters: blue, green, and red. For formal presentations, he printed positive glass slides of these negatives and projected them through a triple lens magic lantern. Prokudin-Gorskii would project the slide through the three lenses, and, with the use of color filters, superimpose the three exposures to form a full color image on a screen. (For more illustrations of Prokudin-Gorskii's methods, see the \"Making Color Images\" section of the exhibit, The Empire That Was Russia.)"
