        "The World War II Rumor Project collection contains manuscript materials compiled by the Office of War Information (OWI). The OWI was established by an Executive order on June 13, 1942, for the purpose of achieving a coordinated governmental war information program. The information program was designed to promote an informed and intelligent understanding of the status and progress of the war effort, war policies, activities, and aims of the United States government. All functions of the Office of Facts and Figures and of the Office of Government Reports, and parts of the functions and related records of two other agencies were transferred to the OWI."

        "After the FSA-OWI photographic prints were microfilmed in LOTs, they were re-sorted and grouped according to geographic region. Paul Vanderbilt devised the arrangement for the photographic prints that would eventually result in the Prints and Photographs Division's FSA-OWI Reading Room File. He established the following geographical divisions: B--Alaska and Canada; D-- Northeastern states; E--Southern states; F--Midwestern states; G--Northwestern states; H-- Southwestern states; J--Farwestern states; and K--Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. There is also a C subdivision for the United States in general, which encompasses a variety of topics, including images used for FSA filmstrips, pictures of FSA exhibit panels, and photographs of clippings of newspaper and magazine articles that used FSA-OWI materials. There are also images of military training and equipment."
