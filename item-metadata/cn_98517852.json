Also, websites for new digital image formats (e.g., Wrist photography, Reicholdarts cell phone photos, and Micah Wright remix posters). Other sites document new ways of displaying the visual arts through virtual galleries (e.g., Alternative Museum) and new ways of representing architectural work and the built environment (e.g., McKissack, Pritzker Prize, Vergara's Invincible Cities, and Vi&#241;oly). Major then-current event themes include views of Kurdistan and the Iraq War."
